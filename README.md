## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Workflow

- Preparing Workflow (Installing Reactjs, Adding assets)

- Identifying and Creating components
    - Layout, Ping, SubscribeForm, ComingSoon, Footer

- Adding CSS Preflight

- Working on mobile design based on `design` folder

- Working on desktop design based on `design` folder

- Working on email validity using React hook

- Writing README.md

- Publish on github.com | app.netlify.com | frontendmentor.io

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [CSS Module](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet) - For styles
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was similar to the previous challenge [Base Apparel](https://github.com/siavhnz/base-apparel-coming-soon-page)
that I solved so It was just more practice on creating components, styling, and
working with hooks


### Continued development

More practice on React
